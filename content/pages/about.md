## What is Startup.js?
Startup.js is the place containing community curated processes, actions, and resources for the budding startups. We believe that actions move the world, so we would like to share actions that world leaders are executing with the community around the world.

Startup.js is owned by a non-profit foundation. Our mission is to make great actions accessible and give you a guide to start.

## What are the plans for Startup.js?
Startup.js is a global community, welcoming people from every discipline and culture who seek guidance budding startups. We believe passionately in the power of actions to change attitudes, lives, and, ultimately, the world. 

On Startup.js.org, we're building a crowdsource of free knowledge from the world's startup leaders and a community to engage with actions, both online and at Startup.js events around the world.

## How does Startup.js make money?
Startup.js makes money through conference attendance fees, sponsorships, foundation support, licensing fees, and book sales, and we spend it as soon as we get it — on video editing, web development, and hosting for Startup.js conference (share actions are free, but bandwidth is expensive…); support for community-driven initiatives, and of course, paying fair salaries to staffers and interns.
Everyone who buys a pass to attend a Startup.js conference is helping share free Startup.js video and text with the world. For this reason, a percentage of the attendance fee is a charitable contribution. And also, the percentage of every donation goes to the author of your choice.

Startup.js on the web is also supported by partnerships with carefully selected organizations; their ads on the videos and website support making Startup.js available to the world for free in many languages and on many platforms. We are very selective in the organizations we partner with. Other projects and initiatives are supported by foundation funding and individual donors.

And of course, we're also supported in kind by volunteers — like all the amazing Startup.js organizers, Startup.js.org moderators, and everyone who ever shares a Startup.js with someone else. (Thank you!)
