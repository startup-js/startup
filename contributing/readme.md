> Accuracy and transparency

At Startup.js, we strive to present information in a way that is both compelling and 100% credible. Claims by our speakers should be true to the best of the speaker's understanding at the time and should be based on what he currently applies. Speakers are expected to be transparent about the basis for any factual claims and provide information to support their statements.

A claim must be based on real-world examples, that context must be made clear in the talk.

> Ensuring rigor in our content

Startup.js employs curators as well as fact-checkers and topic-specific advisors. Before a speaker is invited to the Startup.js stage, we strive to ensure that their content accurately reflects current knowledge in their respective fields, and it's currently been applied.

We also rely on you, Startup.js’s audience, to alert us about questions or concerns via startup.js.org@gmail.com. Please include the speaker’s name and a link to the content you’re flagging.

> Is it OK to simplify?

No, if the topic is complex, we encourage the speaker to narrow down. But he needs to explain end-to-end about their content.
